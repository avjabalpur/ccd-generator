[MARC-HI Nightly Builds]

Before installing this package please take note that it is a nightly build. Nightly builds are a snapshot of the MARC-HI source tree (in binary form) after a day's or week's work has been completed. This build MAY BE IN AN UNSTABLE STATE, and has not passed user, development or regression testing. 

Furthermore, installing this package may cause any existing MARC-HI Everest Framework installations to cease functioning! NEITHER MARC-HI NOR MOHAWK COLLEGE WILL NOT PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR INSTALLATION ISSUES CAUSED BY A NIGHTLY BUILD. 

[FAQ]

When should you install a nightly build?

	- You need a piece of functionality currently not supported by a major release
	- You require a bug-fix or issue resolution not in a major release
	- You wish to try new features or discover code changes made
	
Who should install a nightly?
	
	- Developers, and analysts who are evaluating/testing a bug-fix or feature
	- Users who are using a piece of software developed with a nightly
	- People who like to live on the bleeding edge (those who do so usually bleed the most)
	
Who can I contact if my installation goes wrong or becomes corrupt?

	- Nobody at MARC-HI or Mohawk College supports nightly builds
	- If you received a nightly build from a software vendor, please contact that vendor for support

Why aren't nightly builds provided with first party (Mohawk College) support?
	
	- We can't confirm that a nightly works as it has not passed our thorough testing procedure
	
Why don't the support files (mainly documentation) match the software?

	- Our documentation is usually generated when we release a major version of the software. Because a nightly
	  build does not fall under this category, the documentation and developer's guide (and support files) are
	  not updated in time for nightly builds.
